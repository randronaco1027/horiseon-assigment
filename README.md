## Client Ask

"AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines"

## What Was Provided
The base code that was provided mostly built the site as desired.

However, there was a lot of duplication within the CSS and the use of generic selectors.
The code also was without notes.

## What we did
The title was changed to the name of the company. This helps with Search Engine Optimization.

All duplicate CSS code was removed and the new classes were used in the HTML.

The main selectors were changed from the generic <div> to more descriptive ones such as <header> <section> and <footer>.

Added notes to HTML and CSS to clearly outline what each section is accomplishing.
